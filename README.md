# Bridging the Gap  
Real-Time Sign Language Recognition for Inclusive Communication

## Overview  
Bridging the Gap is a Python-based project that uses MediaPipe, OpenCV, and TensorFlow to recognize sign language gestures in real time. Designed to bridge the communication gap between the hearing and speech-impaired community and the rest of the world, this project converts hand signs into readable text on screen.
