## 📘Overview  
Bridging the Gap is a Python-based project that uses MediaPipe, OpenCV, and TensorFlow to recognize sign language gestures in real time. Designed to bridge the communication gap between the hearing and speech-impaired community and the rest of the world, this project converts hand signs into readable text on screen.

## 🎯Features  
- 📌 Real-time hand detection using MediaPipe  
- 📌 Gesture classification using TensorFlow/Keras  
- 📌 Live video processing via OpenCV  
- 📌 Custom dataset support for different sign languages (e.g., ISL, ASL)  
- 📌 Mobile deployment-ready via TensorFlow Lite


## 🛠️Technology Used 
- Language: Python  
- Libraries:  
  - OpenCV  
  - MediaPipe  
  - TensorFlow / Keras  
  - NumPy, Pandas  
  - Matplotlib (for visualization)
